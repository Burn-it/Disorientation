            Faculty member view on Provost comments at student rally
        </h2>
        <br><br>
        I am a professor who listened to the Provost's remarks at the student rally protesting course cuts at the
        University of Auckland on Thursday afternoon, August 22. Unfortunately, I think a lot of what she said was
        misleading, incomplete, or both at once.
        <br><br>
        Students let the Provost speak first, and she began by rolling out the idea that the "course rationalisation"
        was "faculty-led." This is just not right. Us faculty are just as confused about what is going on as you
        students are.
        <br><br>
        In my faculty and at least several others, this "rationalisation" exercise was dropped on us from on high, from
        out the blue, two weeks ago (August 7 or thereabouts).
        <br><br>
        Our heads of school/department told us, in summary:
        <br><br>
        A bunch of our 3rd and 4th-year courses were in-scope for potential elimination
        We had to provide, on short notice (often 24-48 hours), recommendations and responses about what to cut, what
        not to cut, and why. (Other options including merging courses, teaching them in alternate years, etc.)
        No target was given in terms of number of courses to cut, or the number of classroom hours to save for the
        (apparently drastic) timetabling problems.
        We were told that, if departments/schools did not make recommendations for cuts, these decisions would be made
        for us by higher-ups.
        The word going around was that this required a Covid-level rapidity of response, i.e., an emergency.
        No real explanation was given for why exactly courses had to be cut, many of which have been running for decades
        and have been successfully timetabled every year. It was something about classroom space.
        No real explanation was given for why exactly this was such an emergency, and why the emergency was now. All we
        heard was that the changes to the curriculum had to be decided and approved by October, so that they could get
        approval through CUAP (the Committee on University Academic Programmes, which has to approve changes to tertiary
        qualifications/degrees/majors etc.).
        All of this immediately blew up whatever we were planning to do that week, and the next -- and it is still going
        on of course -- as we all scrambled to figure out what to do, whether to try to compromise to limit the damage
        to the academic quality of our degrees, and/or to try to get this emergency process paused so that real
        discussions, consultation, decisions, and planning could happen carefully and responsibly.
        <br><br>
        Another negative consequence is that faculty members were suddenly stuck debating their colleagues and friends
        over the relative value and importance of their courses and even fields of study, as long-term stable
        arrangements were suddenly up for grabs. This encouraged "every man for himself"-type thinking and potentially
        nasty debates, although thankfully, much of this has been avoided by the widespread recognition that the real
        problem is coming from above.
        <br><br>
        In contrast to what the Provost said, none of this looks like a process that is "faculty-led" (Provost's words),
        or aimed at preserving the "comprehensive education" (Provost's words) that a top world institution like the
        University of Auckland is supposed to offer. It looks like a scramble to try to fix some big upcoming problem
        that was only recently noticed.
        <br><br>
        Although neither the Provost who spoke today, nor any other communications from the University leadership, have
        managed to state this clearly, the impression that faculty have been given from their leadership is that what
        actually happened is the following:
        <br><br>
        The Curriculum Framework Transformation (CFT) includes two brand new course requirements that will be required
        for all first-year students to take, as of 2026. One is termed Waipapa Taumata Rau, or WTR, where each Faculty
        will teach its own version, and one is a Transdisciplinary (TD) course, a number of which faculty are developing
        on different topics.
        Requiring that 2 of the 8 course slots be filled by these courses for all first-year students, and apparently
        furthermore requiring that these courses have in-person discussion sections, is what has completely jammed up
        the room timetabling for 2026. They just don't have enough rooms. And, critically, apparently this was
        recognised only recently, when someone ran modelling or preliminary timetabling. This is what then caused the
        "panic button" to be hit, and the emergency course cuts.
        Given that the CFT has been going for years, this seems like a pretty big failure at the leadership and planning
        level, and now students and faculty are being asked to pay for it.
        <br><br>
        The University Senate seems to have never been told that these new courses would have these radical downstream
        consequences, and of course never had a discussion of these consequences, nor a vote to approve such. This also
        suggests that this key part of CFT planning was perhaps done idealistically, without serious consideration of
        the the practical downsides, or the tradeoffs between adding first year required courses that are of necessity
        very generic, broad-brush generalist courses, but then cutting small, specialist, advanced courses from the
        final years of student degrees.
        <br><br>
        Many faculty raised the question: you are asking us to be flexible -- merging courses, teaching courses in
        alternate years, teaching them outside of the normal term, etc. -- why has no thought been given to doing this
        with the CFT courses, or some part of the CFT courses? The "capstone" courses, yet another "big picture/societal
        issues" paper offered the the 3rd year of many degrees, could also be considered in the mix for rationalisation.
        Also, if classroom space has been maxed out, and (say) 10% more space is needed, surely we could explore
        offering some sections in the evenings, on Saturdays, online, etc.? The word we got back was that these
        suggestions had been repeatedly made to leadership, and had all been rejected.
        <br><br>
        Another option could be that CFT course requirement(s) could be made more flexible. Is it really absolutely
        essential that all students take them in Year 1? Students have diverse goals and diverse plans. Would it really
        be a big deal if some students took CFT courses in Year 2 or Year 3, especially if it helped them fit in the
        core classes they need for their desired major or double-major? Also rejected.
        <br><br>
        (Senate members say they had no idea that the TD course in particular would be a first-year requirement; many
        apparently envisioned it as a later-stage paper, which would make a lot of sense, as the TD courses are each
        focused on a societal/practical problem (e.g. climate change), and you are only likely to become good at finding
        solutions once you have some understanding of the fundamentals.)
        <br><br>
        The Provost today repeatedly suggested that this was all "routine", that departments/programmes routinely review
        their offerings as new courses are added and older courses are sometimes retired due to duplication, staffing,
        student numbers, etc. All that happened this year, she says, is that the leadership and Deans happened to agree
        to do an accelerated and cross-university version of this routine exercise. To paraphrase, "nothing to see here,
        folks."
        <br><br>
        I have yet to find a faculty member who thinks this holds water. The current exercise, with its emergency
        nature, the "we will do it for you if you don't" threats from above, the lack of guidance about exactly what the
        problem is and therefore what counts as a solution (we don't even know how many courses/room hours of savings we
        need to achieve by sacrificing upper-level classes), and especially the lack of forewarning at Senate or
        elsewhere, all has created a head-slapping, hair-tearing-out experience that seems unprecedented rather than
        routine.
        <br><br>
        Speaking of Senate -- the Provost, and other recent University communications, have made it seem like the
        special meeting of University Senate which has been called for Tuesday August 27 is a routine part of the
        consultation and approvals process for these curriculum changes. What actually happened is this:
        <br><br>
        On Monday, July 29, there was a regularly scheduled meeting of Senate. However, this meeting was short, the VC
        was not in attendance, and there was not a whiff of the course-cutting edict which was to come down a mere week
        later.
        <br><br>
        Once the faculty realised that we were being asked to cut courses and otherwise alter the (already accredited)
        curriculum on short notice, without consultation or discussion, and without a Senate vote, they began asking for
        a special meeting of Senate. This began with a formal request on Tuesday August 13. The response from leadership
        was less than rapid, and only after repeated requests was a meeting finally scheduled and announced on Wednesday
        August 21, scheduled for Tuesday August 27, which is unfortunately (a) after the University Council meeting on
        Monday August 26, and (b) on midterm break when many faculty will be away on pre-scheduled travel to conferences
        and research projects. I suspect that faculty attendance will nevertheless be decent, given the stakes, but we
        could have had a Senate meeting already, and provided answers to the students and media as well as faculty.
        Actually, the maximally above-board scenario would have been for University leadership itself to call a special
        Senate meeting as soon as this problem hit their radar, so that we could discuss options and their strengths and
        weaknesses.
        <br><br>
        Apparently what happened instead is that the leadership decision was to brazen their way through, and get the
        cuts made, fast, before opposition could organize. If no Senate meeting had been called, the schedule that had
        been demanded was such that all of this would have been done and dusted by the next regularly-scheduled Senate
        meeting.
        <br><br>
        Some of what I have written above is guesswork, but it represents a widespread understanding among faculty at
        the moment. If there are errors, I hope and encourage that they be corrected by those "in the know" as soon as
        possible. My defence is that we faculty are doing the best we can, given the severe lack of detailed
        information, consultation, and logic in the statements we have heard so far.
        <br><br>
        (For logic problems, consider: the Provost said both "this is not about class sizes", and "small courses are up
        for review" (both are my paraphrases). Students themselves detected the internal conflict and expressed their
        sceptism this afternoon. Another example: a common statement made for why we have to make these changes is to
        increase "relational teaching". "Relational" seems to be one of the new trendy buzzwords, I have asked various
        people using the term what it means, and the practicals of it seem to boil down to (a) small class sizes,
        allowing (b) discussions between students and instructors. A cynic might observe that seminar discussions and
        the like have been a mainstay of advanced university education for centuries. But regardless, if relational
        teaching is the goal, how in the world does putting the smaller, upper-level courses on the chopping block help
        achieve this?)
        <br><br>
        What should happen now? I think leadership needs to take a step back and reconsider their approach here. It
        seems like they are not really doing thorough consultation and thorough listening, instead they are barrelling
        down a predetermined track and seem unconcerned about what gets damaged the service of this "transformation."
        The immediate need is to hit the pause button, so that students, faculty, staff and leadership all have the time
        to have the right discussions and make better decisions in a collaborative, rather than emergency, framework.
        <br><br>
        I hope this has been helpful to students in providing some context, from a faculty member's point of view, on
        recent events and on the Provost's comments.
